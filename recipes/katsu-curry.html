    <ul>
        <li>1 kg beef chuck, cut into 3cm cubes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>75g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>75g plain flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp curry powder (or 2 tbsp curry powder and 1 tbsp garam masala)</li>
        <li>Â¼ tsp chilli powder (or to taste)</li>
        <li>150g shimeji mushrooms, broken into clumps</li>
        <li>1 large brown onion, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>3 large carrots, peeled and cut into irregular chunks</li>
        <li>2 sebago potatoes, peeled and cut into irregular chunks</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 apple, grated</li>
        <li>Japanese pickles (rakkyo and fukujinzuke), to serve</li>
        <li>Cooked Japanese rice, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and fry the beef in batches until well browned.</li>
        <li>Return all of the beef to the saucepan and add around 2L of water to completely cover the meat.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer and simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours, skimming to remove any scum that forms on the surface.</li>
        <li>When the beef is tender (but not falling apart), add in the potato and carrot and simmer for a further 15 minutes until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and strain off the solids, reserving the stock.</li>
        <li>Heat another large saucepan and add in the butter and flour.</li>
        <li>Stir with a wooden spoon to combine into a roux and cook until just starting to turn colour.</li>
        <li>Add in the curry powder, garam masala, and chilli powder and stir for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add in the stock a ladle at a time until a smooth sauce develops. Add more stock or water if it is too thick.</li>
        <li>Add the shimeji mushrooms, sliced onion, grated apple, and other remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes until the onion is softened, stirring regularly to stop the sauce from sticking to the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat. Stir through the beef, potatoes, and carrot, adjust seasoning for saltiness, and allow to stand covered for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning (you will probably need to add some additional salt) and then serve with rice and pickles.</li>
      </ol>
