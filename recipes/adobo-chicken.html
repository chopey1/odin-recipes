    <h1>Adobo chicken</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>750g / 1.5 lb chicken thigh fillets, boneless and skinless (5 - 6 pieces) <em>(Note 1)</em></li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (85ml) soy sauce, ordinary all-purpose or light (not dark soy sauce, <em>Note 2</em>)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup + 2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves (fresh) or 3 dried</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil, separated (vegetable, canola, or peanut)</li>
        <li>1 small brown onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp whole black pepper (substitute 2 tsp coarse cracked pepper)</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar, and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer, then turn heat down to medium-high. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup. If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by
        itself—it will thicken much quicker—then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
        <li>Coat chicken in glaze, then serve over rice. Pictured in the post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.</li>
